This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This idea of this exercise is to test your knowledge of `React` and `javascript`, as well as some basic `css` and `html` concepts.

We expect you to spend no more than three hours on this exercise.

In the `App.js` file you will find a function `getContacts`, this function mocks an API call and returns a Promise of an Array.

Your task is to create a simple table of contacts, with two filters.

The table and filters should look like this:



The name filter takes a string and matches against the full name (first and last name) of the contact, leaving all contacts that have the string somewhere in either their first or last names, in the table.

The state filter should have a selectable list (dropdown) of all states in the contacts list. And when a state is selected should leave only those contacts from that state in the table.

You should NOT use any additional npm packages.

You SHOULD use ES6 syntax if you can.

Layout and other styling should be done LAST, and only if you have time.
