#### This exercise is designed to...
- Test your knowledge of `React` and `javascript`
- Test some basic `css` and `html` concepts
- Get an idea of how you write code

### We expect you to spend no more than three hours on this exercise.

## Your Task

In the `App.js` file you will find a function `getContacts`, this function mocks an API call and returns a Promise of an Array.

Your task is to create a simple table of contacts, with two filters.

#### The table and filters should look like this:

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/react-exercise.jpg" width="600" title="hover text">
</p>

### Filters

##### Name Filter
- name filter takes a string and matches against the full name (first and last name) of the contact
- leaving all contacts that have the string somewhere in either their first or last names, in the table

#### State Filter
- state filter should have a selectable list of all states in the contacts list
- when a state is selected should leave only those contacts from that state in the table
- the first and initial option in the selectable list should be `all` which does not filter the table

<div align="left">
  <img src="images/dropdown_one.png" width="120" title="hover text">
</div>
<div align="left">
  <img src="images/dropdown_two.png" width="120" title="hover text">
</div>

### Important

- You should NOT use any additional npm packages.

- You SHOULD use ES6 syntax if you can.

- Layout and other styling should be done LAST, and only if you have time.
